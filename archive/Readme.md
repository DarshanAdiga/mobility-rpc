The googlecode-tags directory contains complete copies of Mobility-RPC source code for each of the Mobility-RPC releases
which were made while Mobility-RPC was hosted in Subversion on Google Code: versions <=1.1.0, released prior to
September 2015.

Mobility-RPC versions >1.1.0 (since September 2015), will be released from GitHub, and tags for those versions can be
found directly in the GitHub repository.
